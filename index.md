I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028. 

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 11, part 1


This lab is my favorite because it was challenging. In this lab,we were sorting through a vector of vectors, which was very interesting. This taught me how to use nested for loops and how to sort through the rows and columns of the vector. This also helped me ingrain in my head that c++ is a row major order language. It helped me understand how these concepts we are learning in class can translate into the storage of data and how they can be used in future programs

* Lab 11, part 2


This part of the same lab is also one of my favorites because it introduced the usage of classes in code. It mainly taught me how to initialize constructors and how to deal with hidden private variables declared in the .h file. This is completely different from my previous experiences coding in java, and was super interesting to me. This program also created a very simple fun game to play, and felt rewarding to complete.

* Lab 08, part 1


This program was my third favorite because we worked with a lot of for loops, and I finally began understanding the for each loop after this lab. The for each loop is something that I’ve always struggled with in my past coding experiences, so it felt really good to finally understand and be able to use these. While the program wasn’t the most interesting, it felt really good to finally understand how to use this type of for loop.
